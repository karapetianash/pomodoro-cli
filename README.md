## Description
The Pomodoro is a time management approach that allows you to focus
on tasks by defining a short time interval to concentrate on it, called
Pomodoro, followed by short and long breaks to allow you to rest and
reprioritize tasks. In general, a Pomodoro interval lasts 25 minutes while
breaks are typically 5 and 15 minutes.
